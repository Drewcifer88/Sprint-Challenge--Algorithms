#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
I believe that this problem will have a run time complexity of 0(n). Despite the size of the input data it will run in the same space/time because every input will be constant and not change the rate while running.

b)
this sequence runs O(n log n), the run time grows in proportion to the input size. Or in other words it the biger the input the greater the rate of change.

c)
I believe this code will also run at O(n) because it will only ever increment by 2 and the input size never changes.

## Exercise II

Hmm you would want to be able to find the middle floor of the building and move from there. If eggs break from that floor you could decrement by 1 and move down floors to find 'f' by returning the floor index. Then you would know which floors would be safe to drop eggs from.
